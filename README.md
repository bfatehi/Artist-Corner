# Artist-Corner

This is a version of an Iphone app I designed to help discover and manage talent.  It can also be used to create projects and collaborate amongst others on the app.

Basic setup and podfiles are at the top level of the directory and specific models and view controller are contained within the Artist Corner folder.

Views for segmented controls applies to the project view. These views are interchanged and populated upon clicking on the segmented view button.

This app uses older versions of firebase for realtime database calls as well as facebook sdk for profile creation and profile picture pulling. BSKeyboard Controls
found on github is also used for keyboard toolbar navigation.
